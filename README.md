# EasyDict

Hello everyone, I previously created a command line Python-translator application which I previously included on my github. This 
is the same program rebuilt into a web application using Flask. It's got the home page where you can define words, as well as 
a few other pages I added to have some fun and personalize the website. The frontend was created using the Bootstrap framework.
